# togglesite-macos

python script for macos to block bad websites for productivity (modified version from @dnbt777 for macos)

## usage

```
sudo python3 toggle_site_blocking_macos.py <site name|list>
```

## safari bug for x.com
safari dns caching or something like this was giving problem when trying to block x.com with safari opened.
to fix this bug i decided to automatically disconnect and reconnect the wifi (i have a laptop), otherwise you would need to manually restart safari.
