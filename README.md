# togglesite-macos

python script for macos to block bad websites for productivity (modified version from @dnbt777 for macos)

## usage

```
sudo python3 toggle_site_blocking_macos.py <site name|list>
```

## safari bug for x.com
safari dns caching or something similar was causing problems when trying to block x.com with safari open

to fix this bug i decided to automatically disconnect and reconnect the wifi (i have a laptop), otherwise you would need to manually restart safari
